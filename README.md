# 🌊 TrendTide News
This is a React project I created as part of my learning journey into frontend development. TrendTide News fetches and displays articles, users, and topics, allowing visitors to read and interact with the content. However, full features such as commenting and waving are only available to logged-in users. All data and interactions are connected to my previously built back-end API

Throughout this project, I focused on connecting the frontend to the backend, fetching and displaying data using useEffect, useState, and conditional rendering. I also handled GET, PATCH, and POST requests, worked with dynamic routing via useParams and useSearchParams, used Context to provide user state availability throughout all components, and built reusable components while managing state with React hooks
